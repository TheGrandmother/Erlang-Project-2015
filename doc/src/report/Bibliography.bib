	Abstract = {We describe an artificial ant colony capable of solving the traveling salesman problem (TSP).
Ants of the artificial colony are able to generate successively shorter feasible tours by using
information accumulated in the form of a pheromone trail deposited on the edges of the TSP
graph. Computer simulations demonstrate that the artificial ant colony is capable of generating
good solutions to both symmetric and asymmetric instances of the TSP. The method is an
example, like simulated annealing, neural networks, and evolutionary computation, of the
successful use of a natural metaphor to design an optimization algorithm.},
